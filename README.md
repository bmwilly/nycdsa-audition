This is a mini-analysis of the guests of "The Daily Show". The data set comes
from the [fivethirtyeight data repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data).
As part of the analysis, we recreate a plot from their post [Every Guest Jon Stewart Ever Had On ‘The Daily Show’](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/every-guest-jon-stewart-ever-had-on-the-daily-show/).

### Setup
From R,
```r
install.packages(c('readr', 'plyr', 'dplyr', 'cowplot', 'scales', 'ggthemes'))
```

### Run
```bash
make run-analysis
```
